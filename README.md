## Description of project
Talio is a task management application that enables users to organize their work into lists and prioritize them. The application has a client-server architecture where users can connect to a server to manage their tasks, allowing users to access their boards from anywhere at anytime, over the internet. The application is built with Spring and JavaFX, and uses HTTP, JSON, and WebSockets for client-server communication.
