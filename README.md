# Starting template

This README will need to contain a description of your project, how to run it, how to set up the development environment, and who worked on it.
This information can be added throughout the course, except for the names of the group members.
Add your own name (do not add the names for others!) to the section below.

## Description of project
Talio is a task management application that enables users to organize their work into lists and prioritize them. The application has a client-server architecture where users can connect to a server to manage their tasks. The application is built with Spring/JavaFX and uses HTTP,JSON, and WebSockets for client-server communication.
