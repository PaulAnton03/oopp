### Backlog

### Submission

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The backlog draft was delivered on time.


### Backlog Structure

Mark: Pass

Feedback: Your backlog contains stakeholders, terminology and a list of user stories.

### Epics

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: The prioritization of stories is good and it is consistent with lecture. Unfortunately there was a misunderstanding regarding Moscow method and epics and you should group your features using Epics not Moscow method.
This should not that you long because the prioritization of stories is good. Please use the slides as a reference of how to group them into epics and the example from last year for the user stories.

### User Stories

Mark: Good

Feedback: The user stories follow the required format. I also liked that your requirements were written from the user perspective. All required iteractions are covered.The size of most user story is small and their effect is clear.
You should be careful with the user stories format. You also need to state the reason why you want that functionality("so that..."). For most user stories you state this, but for some this is missing.

### Acceptance Criteria

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: For each user story you should add acceptance criteria (see slides). This is mandatory and you must add this to your backlog.
