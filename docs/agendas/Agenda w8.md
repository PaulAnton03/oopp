### Introduction
- How was everyone's week?
- How do you feel about our progress last week?
- Anything anyone wants to complain about?
### Deadlines
- Multiple deadlines approaching.
- How are we going to handle the product pitch?
- How do we feel about the heuristic evaluation? Did everybody add something to pump up the word count?
- Did everyone submit the personal reflection?
### Project
- We're almost done! (but not really)
- What is there left to do?
- What does each one of us plan on contributing this week? Perhaps it would be a good idea to plan the upcoming features?
- Is everyone's code contribution healthy? Are we evenly divided?
- Should we have another meeting to wrap things up?
### Final notes
