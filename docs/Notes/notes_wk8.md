#Notes of meeting 04/04/2023:
#Week 8
#Chairman: Alex Despan
#Note Taker: Yusuf Ã–zdemir

Everybody's week is fine. Ana's week was also good.
Everybody is satisfied with the last weeks progress.
Heuristics and code (also product pitch) deadline is set at tuesday.

We failed the self reflection because of not respecting the given requirement.
So we must make it in the format of bullet points.

We will hold a meeting about video.
##Heuristics: we need to pump up the word count.

Regarding the deadlines: We should prepare and do task division later.

##Things left to do:
- couple more features about customisation
- very few shortcut options
- tags (needs bugfix)
- subtask (just frontend)
- a lot of tests


Another meeting will be held thursday. (at noon?) Will be discussed in discord later on.
