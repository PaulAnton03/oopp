Date: 28-2-2023
W3 meeting
Chair person: Błażej
Note taker: Radu


### Backlog draft feedback:
- Change it according to the proper principles
- Use epics instead of moscow method
- Very well structured user stories
- basic epic: must features (acceptance criteria)
- other epics like in lecture: include user stories
- for each user story, add acceptance criteria (what makes the story done)
- if story is ambiguous, we can add more acceptance criteria, if it is concrete, acceptance criteria not necessary.
- replace categories with epics
- good idea having admin stakeholder
- Specific password for admin, access to everything
- Break down user stories to avoid acceptance criteria

### Backlog:

### Git assignment:

### General:
- (Optional scrum meetings)
- Start coding this week, on the project
- Until next friday, meaningful MR
- !! Leave comments and review code before approving merge requests
- 2 people review the code
- branch dev => make branches we work on => merge them on dev => merge on main
- Comments on merges should include feedback on code and possible improvements
- Split team in 2 parts (client/server), maybe switch teams every week
- Contribution in GitLab is graded.
- After we submit backlog, we can transform user stories in issues on GitLab
- Create milestones, add all issues we want to do in each week.
- Suggest waiting on official backlog and add issues on gitlab, solve issues with MR.
- Meaningful = at least one issue solved.
